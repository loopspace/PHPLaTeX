\section{Introduction}

PHPLaTeX is a program for converting LaTeX documents into XHTML+MathML+SVG.
It's main selling points are that it is written entirely in PHP and that it attempts to mimic the basic TeX method of parsing a document by reading and expanding tokens.
The main consequence of the first of these is that it is extremely portable.
The main consequence of the second is that it can handle macro expansion.

Not everything is implemented yet, and things that are may not be implemented fully.
A full list of the currently available commands, together with some notes on specific commands, is given at the end.

\section{Commands}

\subsection{Primitives}

Primitives are PHP functions.
They generally need to muck around with the internals of the system and so need access to the ``lower level'' of the program.
