2009-06-18  Andrew Stacey  <andrew.stacey@math.ntnu.no>

	* math.php (vecAngle): Added angle function.

	* primitives/xymatrix.php: Changed arrowheads from markers to
	actual SVG elements to enable use as masks.  This fixes the issue
	of lines overrunning the arrowheads.

2009-06-17  Andrew Edgell Stacey  <andrew.stacey@math.ntnu.no>

	* math.php (vecXY): Added units specification.

	* primitives/xymatrix.php (if): Started adding support for
	arguments (find out what += and -= actually do).
	Used masks for punching holes in arrows: required shifting label
	calculation to earlier in arrow calculation, and definition of a
	new global variable: $clip to keep track of mask references in
	different diagrams.

	* math.php: Renamed svg.php to math.php.  Added more posibilities
	for converting a vector to a string.

	* primitives/xymatrix.php: Label positioning seems much better,
	added a margin around diagram and padding on foreignObjects.
	Completed transition to vector arithmetic.  Technically possible
	to have lots of labels on an arrow, not just three!

	* primitives/xymatrix.php: Modified to use vector mathematics,
	arrows work fine but label positioning needs work.

	* latex.php: Split off diagram making routines into svg.php:
	getWidthOf, getHeightOf, getDepthOf, MakeEx.

2009-06-15  Andrew Edgell Stacey  <andrew.stacey@math.ntnu.no>

	* primitives/xymatrix.php (for): Began altering arrow computations
	to make arrows point to centres of targets, and incorporating new
	height and depth calculations.

	* latex.php (expandtok): Added mathchar enclosure for bare
	entities in math mode.

2009-06-11  Andrew Stacey  <andrew.stacey@math.ntnu.no>

	* latex.php: Added basic GPL notice.

	* doc/PHPLaTeX.tex: Wrote basic documentation.

2009-06-10  Andrew Stacey  <andrew.stacey@math.ntnu.no>

	* primitives/xymatrix.php: Shifted arrowheads into a separate
	file.  Still have to load them, though.  Would prefer off-document
	referencing but haven't figured that out.  Should load at the
	start of the document, though.
	(for): Added coordinates and direction of mid-point of curve,
	useful for adding decorations to the middle.
	Maybe label points should also know their directions?
	(for): Added ability to have markers at the middle of the arrow;
	syntax is stem{arrow}stem, where the outermost stems have to be
	the same.

2009-06-08  Andrew Stacey  <andrew.stacey@math.ntnu.no>

	* primitives/documentclass.php: for now, just swallows the class name.

	* latex.php (initialise): default.sty is automatically loaded
	(expandtok): implemented largeop switch for super and subscripts
	(uses array $isLargeOp).
	(expandtok): Changed switch for super and subscripts to test for
	'movablelimits' - doesn't seem to display correctly in inline
	mode, though.
	(initialise): added $commands to global list so that \\ works properly

	* form.html: Calls convert.php on the text in the text box.

	* convert.php: Created.  Converts a string and displays it.
	Can also load a file from the 'doc' directory.

	* packages/default.sty: split off amsmath specific stuff into
	amsmath.sty, added 'document' environment and 'title' command
