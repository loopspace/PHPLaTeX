	* primitives/documentclass.php: for now, just swallows the class name.

	* latex.php (initialise): default.sty is automatically loaded
	(expandtok): implemented largeop switch for super and subscripts
	(uses array $isLargeOp).
	(expandtok): Changed switch for super and subscripts to test for
	'movablelimits' - doesn't seem to display correctly in inline
	mode, though.
	(initialise): added $commands to global list so that \\ works properly

	* form.html: Calls convert.php on the text in the text box.

	* convert.php: Created.  Converts a string and displays it.
	Can also load a file from the 'doc' directory.

	* packages/default.sty: split off amsmath specific stuff into
	amsmath.sty, added 'document' environment and 'title' command
